    <h2>Web Design</h2>
    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The
    different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including
    standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often
    many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover
    them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client
    side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope
    of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web
    accessibility guidelines.</p>
