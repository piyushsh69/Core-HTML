    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete,
    often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that
    the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single
    individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s,
    "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs
    from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for
    an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and
    single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.
    
    The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated
    the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming.
    Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on
    the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are
    interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that
    distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking
    service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with
    their readers and other bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate
    speech or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.</p>
